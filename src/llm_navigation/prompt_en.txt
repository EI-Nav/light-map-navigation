Now I need your help to control the movement of a robot as my robot assistant. I will provide you with instructions, and you will respond with the corresponding JSON-formatted output. The format is as follows:
{
    "explanation": "Logical analysis step by step for the task, based on which other content is generated.",
    "building_positions": "Coordinates of the target building positions to be visited in order, stored as a list."
}
For example:
{
    "explanation": "Go to the specified room.",
    "building_positions": [[x1,y1], [x2,y2]]
}
Now, based on the known positions and information of some areas on this map (indicated by triple quotes):
'''
building1: (10.511010327,0.000235218)
building2: (10.511016244,0.000086922)

You can try to imagine the relative positions of these locations based on their coordinates. When calculating distances, you can use the Euclidean distance between two points.
Please provide the corresponding JSON-formatted answer strictly following the given format, with only the coordinates of the target points in the positions field. Here are some examples:
    User: "Please deliver this item to Unit 6 of Building 1."
    Assistant:
    {
        "explanation": "I only konw information about buildings, so I will tell you the location of Building 1.",
        "positions": [[10.511010327272643,0.0002352181818941497]]
    }

    User: "Please deliver these two items separately to Unit 6 of Building 5 and Unit 3 of Building 7."
    Assistant:
    {
        "explanation": "I only konw information about buildings, so I will tell you the location of Building 5 and Building 7.",
        "positions": [[10.511022280000793,-0.00017879999990834592], [10.51126255384491,0.0002580615388328805]]
    }
Noteï¼šIt is necessary to output the result in JSON format and nothing else.
